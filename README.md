# Tic-Tac-Toe

13 of April:

I don't think I really 'got' the intricacies of the factory and module patterns, or even, like... their point...
Nevertheless, I'll try to implement them to the best of my ability. The game itself doesn't seem too complicated to code, it's just that these patterns put werid restrictions on the way the is structured.
How do I check if the game is over? Probably by brute force iterating over all rows, columns and diagonals, but it just seems so, so inelegant. And it wouldn't scale well.
Don't think I'll bother with A.I., because I didn't understand that Wiki article at all.
